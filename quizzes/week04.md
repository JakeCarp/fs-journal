# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
asynchronous code is a block of code flagged as such, allowing it to be paused while waiting for the return of another function while synchronous code executes in order without waiting. 
```

```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A callback is a function inside of a function, creating a process that can process functions based on the outputs of others. 
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

the service layer is what will make calls to the api
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
