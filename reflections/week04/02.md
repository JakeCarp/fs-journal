## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, Resolved, and Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Because sticking functions in a promise is cleaner, easier to read, and more efficient that nesting functions. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then is what runs when the promise is resolved, where as if there is an error .catch is what will run
