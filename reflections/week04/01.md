> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Seeing a function pass more than one callback is a good sign that you're in callback hell, the use of these massive function pyramids are a usual suspect. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous code is code that can be paused while it's waiting for the results of another peice of code. This actually can replace callbacks to a large degree because you can simply wait the results of a non-nested function. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keeping your code shallow, modular, and handling all of your errors will help keep you out of callback hell
