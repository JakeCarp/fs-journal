## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is what is used to identify the records on a table most often. A foreign key is added to a record to establish a relationship between it and a record or records on another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is a variable that stands in to represent the product of a certain query. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT * 
FROM doctors
WHERE doctorID = @id
JOIN patients p WHERE p.id = patientId
JOIN doctors d WHERE d.id = doctorId

```
