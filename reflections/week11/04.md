## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have a great time coming through for a second time, compentency is a great way to be and I have enjoyed finding mine again. I don't really have any concerns, I feel pretty confident going forward and plans for several projects. I think I most enjoyed my classmates, the value of the course aside, Covid has been pretty lonely and community is something sorely missed by many. I enjoyed seeing everyone every day.
