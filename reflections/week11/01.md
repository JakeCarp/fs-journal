## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Class inheritance is super important because of the access to base methods and properties that it allows. It also identifies the child class more clearly. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

    Classes do not inherit all memebers of a parent class, things like constructors are not passed to child classes. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

    Private members are not visible to child classes, so they remain only accessible in the local scope.
