# Final Reflection
The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?


It went well, a little stressful with the interview processes that I've been involved with though. I got a slower start than I would have liked but I got it done a day early in the end. 

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
