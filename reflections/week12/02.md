# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

I didn't get as much done as I wanted. A little bit of work done on the front end but my work on the backend has ground to a halt. I don't know what the test that I'm failing wants me to do at all. I'm not worried I won't finish, I just want it over with. 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
