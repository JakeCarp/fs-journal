## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

    Timeboxing is a time management strategy where you limit yourself to a certain amount of time with a problem before asking for outside help or advice. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

    setting timers when you find a problem you can't solve, having a support network for your work, and working on only one problem at a time. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Constantly during work. Specifically when I was helping with a cloud environment migration at my first job. I would always get hung up because I was so new to it so I had to use timeboxing a lot.
