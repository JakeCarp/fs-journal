## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Using console.log() is the primary method, but errors will also typically write themselves to the console. Usually you should be using logging to debug and wire up your application. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab shows HTML/CSS, this is useful because it lets you change the styling and HTML elements right in the browser.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using breakpoints is usually better for debugging than logging. Especially when it comes to finding out what specific part of a function is breaking.
