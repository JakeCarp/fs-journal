## Questions

Q: What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A: Pseudo-Classes are used to condition the special selector with some special state. An example of this is the :hover pseudo-class, which activates the selector when the cursor is hovering over the element. other super common ones are :enabled and :disabled and the tree structural pseudo-classes. 


Q: What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

A: Specificity is the process that CSS uses to determine which rule is used given the situation that two rules are operating on the same property of an element. It's useful because you can build general rules that change all elements of the same type, then use specificity to change particular elements as needed.   

Q:What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

A:the !important feature should be seldom used as it overwrights any other conflicting rule, if you were to apply this feature on a rule that was very general on accident you could change the styling of nearly your entire page without meaning too. This could be disasterous in a real world application.
