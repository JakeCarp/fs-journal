## Questions
Q: In your own words, why do we use Git?

A: Git is a source control tool, it's used to manage the cumulative build-up of iterative code that makes up applications. As developers write new and fix old code, Git allows them to keep track of what versions had what features. It's also useful for keeping track of who is doing what, tagging code being added with the authors details.

Q: What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

A: Branching is useful for partitioning peices of an applications so that multiple teams can work on different parts at the same time, without breaking each others code. These parts can then later be spliced together to get the results of both teams work. You can also use branching to explore different options as far as design or fuctional specifics of an app. 

Q: What is the difference between Git and GitHub

A: Git is the tool that developers use for source control, whereas GitHub is a platform that was designed to leverage that tool over the web. Github primary purpose is the storage of your code, using the Git framework. Additionally, GitHub provides visualization, additional tools, and social networking between developers.
