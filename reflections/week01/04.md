## Questions

Q: What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

A: wireframing is the process of making mocks of your final product at varying levels of detail. The idea being to give yourself an objective so that you stay user-focused and you know what exactly it is you're making before you start. This prevents unnessesary work. 

Q: What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

A: There is low-fi, mid-fi, and high-fi in acending order of detail. Low-fi offers a broad over view of your application and helps refine things like layout and screen order. Mid-fi is where you begin to define your features and mock out design specifics while avoiding specific content. high-fi is a pixel specific layout and includes things like color and other final design choices. 

Q: Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

A: Totally, the amount of time that wireframing saves in the long run makes the process worth doing. It prevents extra work on features that will just get cut out of the final product and the endless process of styling on the fly until you're happy.
