# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
This week went quite well, the lessons are allowing me to recall more than the actual content of the lecture and leverage that into more. I'm feeling much better about my design capability despite not actually doing that in my entire career. I hope this trend continues!
