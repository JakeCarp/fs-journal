## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing allows you to test individual blocks of code independent of its context, Component testing tests whole components of code, and E2E is a whole product testing process. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think component testing is the most useful as you are working, then you would want an E2E test once you are feature complete

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Probably unit testing, removing code from its context doesn't give you the vital information that what you are writing will break the rest of the component or even the whole app.
