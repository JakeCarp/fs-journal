2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Changing the number of points in a sprint and other adjustments to the scale of a sprint are important for small SCRUM teams. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
